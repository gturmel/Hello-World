# Hello-World
My First Repository

My name is Greg Turmel. I'm starting the Iron Yard on Feb 1, and I'm a little excited and very nervous about what the future holds. I plan on diving into the class strongly from the word 'go'. I'm also in the midst of drawing up a schedule for my time - need to make sure I keep working out and keep eating decently while I'm in the weeds.
